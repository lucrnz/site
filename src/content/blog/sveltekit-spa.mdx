> 🧑‍💻 This article assumes you have intermediate experience with the command line.

Recently, I been working on a side-project, and I decided to build a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) for it's UI. So I wanted to share this information with y'all.

Previously, you would use something like [svelte-navigator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-navigator) or [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router), In fact, you can still use this tools today!

However, Sveltekit exists for a reason, and that is to have an opinionated way for building web applications with Svelte.

As Rich Harris said, the [Svelte framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svelte) creator, other solutions might have their flaws.

I won't list the reasons [why server-side rendering is better](https://www.phind.com/search?q=Why+should+I+avoid+building+a+single-page-application+and+prefer+a+solution+with+server-side+rendering+instead%3F&ignoreSearchResults=false&allowMultiSearch=false) or [when should you build an SPA instead](https://www.phind.com/search?q=When+should+I+prefer+building+a+single-page-application+instead+of+running+a+server+that+provides+SSR.++What+are+it%27s+benefits%3F&ignoreSearchResults=false&allowMultiSearch=false). Every choice has it's pros and cons.

## Getting started

Let's create a new project

<TabContainer tabs={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
<div slot="tab-1">
```
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```
</div>
<div slot="tab-2">
```
pnpm create svelte@latest my-app
```
</div>
</TabContainer>

The program will make you some questions, I will choosing the option that says "SvelteKit demo app", and I will choose to use TypeScript.

I will skip any of the aditional options.

```
┌  Welcome to SvelteKit!
│
◇  Which Svelte app template?
│  SvelteKit demo app
│
◇  Add type checking with TypeScript?
│  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
│
◇  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
│  none
│
└  Your project is ready!
```

Open your favorite code editor with that folder. I will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Don't forget to install the packages.

<TabContainer tabs={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
<div slot="tab-1">
```
npm i
```
</div>
<div slot="tab-2">
```
pnpm i
```
</div>
</TabContainer>

## How to enable SPA mode

You can also consult the official documentation [in this link](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/single-page-apps)

Lets create the following file `src/routes/+layout.ts`

```sh
touch src/routes/+layout.ts
```

Add the following contents:

```ts
export const ssr = false;
```

> ⚠ Do not confuse this file with `+layout.svelte` they're different files, and only in the `.ts` this will work.

Now we have to switch the adapter, to use the static one.

<TabContainer tabs={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
<div slot="tab-1">
```
npm remove @sveltejs/adapter-auto
npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static
```
</div>
<div slot="tab-2">
```
pnpm remove @sveltejs/adapter-auto
pnpm add -D @sveltejs/adapter-static
```
</div>
</TabContainer>

Open the file that contains the svelte config `svelte.config.js`

Replace the adapter to use the static one, here is how it should look like:

```ts
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	// Consult https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/integrations#preprocessors
	// for more information about preprocessors
	preprocess: vitePreprocess(),

	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			fallback: 'index.html' // may differ from host to host
		})
	}
};

export default config;
```

This should be enough to turn it into an SPA.

You can run the application if you want to play around with it.

<TabContainer tabs={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
<div slot="tab-1">
```
npm run dev
```
</div>
<div slot="tab-2">
```
pnpm run dev
```
</div>
</TabContainer>

## How to dockerize any Single-page-application

> TL;DR: Run any http server that allows rewrites and redirect everything to "index.html".

Let's do that! For that, I will using nginx.

✍ Create a file called `nginx.conf`

```
events {}

http {
    default_type application/octet-stream;
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen 3000;
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;

        
        gzip on;
        gzip_types text/html application/javascript application/json text/css;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ $uri.html /index.html;
        }

        location ~* \.(?:css|js|svg|jpg|png|webp|mp4|m4a|webm|ogg|opus)$ {
            expires 30d;
            add_header Cache-Control "public";
        }

        location ~* \.(?:json)$ {
            expires 1d;
            add_header Cache-Control "public";
        }
    }
}
```

You can tune in this config if you want to, here you can see that it gives a long time cache for any static request.

Create a file called `.dockerignore`

```sh
touch .dockerignore
```

Add the following contents:

```
.git
.gitignore
dist
build
Dockerfile*
node_modules
*.md
.env*
.svelte*
```

Create a file called `Dockerfile`
```sh
touch Dockerfile
```

As expected, the contents vary depending on the package manager you are using.

<TabContainer tabs={["npm", "pnpm"]}>
<div slot="tab-1">
```Dockerfile
FROM node:lts AS builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm ci
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:latest as runner

COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
</div>
<div slot="tab-2">
```Dockerfile
FROM node:lts AS builder
WORKDIR /app
ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest-8 --activate

COPY . .

RUN pnpm install
RUN pnpm run build

FROM nginx:latest as runner

COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
</div>
</TabContainer>

Let's build the docker image:

```sh
docker build -t my-app .
```

Run the container with the following command:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -t my-app
```

This will forward the port "3000" from the container to match :3000 on your local computer.

🧠 Learn more about [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/)

That should be all!

👋 Happy coding!
